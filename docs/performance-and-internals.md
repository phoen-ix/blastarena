# Performance & Internals

Optimizations across the game loop, network layer, and rendering pipeline for low-latency multiplayer.

## Network & Bandwidth

- **Delta tile encoding**: `toTickState()` sends only changed tiles as `tileDiffs` array instead of full `map.tiles` grid every tick — client stores initial tiles from `game:start` and applies diffs in-place. `toState()` still sends full tiles for replays, simulations, and initial state. `TileDiff` type in `shared/src/types/game.ts`
- **Socket.io per-message compression**: `perMessageDeflate` enabled with 256-byte threshold — compresses JSON payloads ~60-70%
- **Room list broadcast debouncing**: `broadcastRoomList()` coalesced via `setImmediate()` — multiple rapid room mutations produce a single broadcast
- **Game input hot path**: `game:input` socket handler uses cached `socket.data.activeRoomCode` instead of Redis `getPlayerRoom()` lookup per input — eliminates ~600 Redis calls/sec per active room. Set on room create/join/reconnect, cleared on leave/disconnect
- `GameRoom.broadcastState()` passes raw `gameState.map.tiles` reference to `ReplayRecorder` (via shallow object spread) so replays get actual tile data while broadcasts send empty tiles array with diffs

## Bot AI Tick Throttling

Bot AI runs full `generateInput()` every other tick (even ticks only); odd ticks reuse last input via `_lastBotInputs` cache — halves bot CPU cost with minimal behavior impact (decisions update every 100ms instead of 50ms).

`_lastBotInputs: Map<number, PlayerInput>` stores each bot's last decision; cleared when bot returns null input.

## Tile Change Tracking

- `_dirtyTiles: Map<string, TileDiff>` in `GameStateManager` tracks tile mutations per tick
- `destroyTileTracked()` wraps `CollisionSystem.destroyTile()` and records the change — used in bomb detonation and meteor impacts
- `toTickState()` drains `_dirtyTiles` into `tileDiffs` array, then clears the map. Only real changes are recorded — a blast cell whose tile was already floor produces no diff. `tileChangeLog` keeps every change for the game's lifetime so isolated bot AIs can sync their in-isolate grid incrementally
- `GameLoop` hands consumers a lazy serializer (`onTick(serialize)`), so the campaign serializes once, after its own `campaignTick()`, instead of discarding the loop's state and building a full one; `toTickState()` must run exactly once per tick because it drains the diff buffer
- Tick entries omit static data after it has been sent once: `Player.toTickState()` drops `cosmetics` after the first tick, `Explosion.toTickState()` sends `cells` once, `map.spawnPoints` is empty. `GameScene.hydrateState()` and `ReplayRecorder` fill the gaps from per-id caches
- Chain-reaction tile snapshot is copy-on-write (`beginTileSnapshot()` / `preserveSnapshotRow()`): a shallow copy of the row array, rows cloned only when first mutated inside the batch
- Per-tick indexes replace the O(players × N) scans: a lethal-cell map for explosion damage, a position map for power-up pickups; teleporter pads are cached and invalidated by `setTileTracked`
- Player occupancy inside a tick is live (`TickOccupancy`): entries are mutated as players move so later-processed players see earlier moves; `CollisionSystem.canMoveTo` exempts the mover and its own buddy via `selfId` instead of callers filtering copies
- `CollisionSystem.isWalkable` is a Set lookup; the bot BFS uses `canMoveToKeyed(x, y, dir, blockedKeys)` (one hash lookup per step) with the blocked set built once per search

## Per-Tick Caching

- `getAlivePlayers()` result cached within `processTick()` (guarded by `_processingTick` flag); invalidated via `invalidateAliveCache()` after every death/respawn — eliminates 7+ redundant `Array.from().filter()` per tick
- Bomb slide collision uses pre-built `Set<string>` for bomb and player positions — O(1) lookups instead of O(n) inner loops. Sets only built when `hasSlidingBombs` is true (~5% of ticks)
- Shared position data built once per tick and passed to all `processPlayerInput()` calls: `sharedBombPositions` (array), `sharedPlayerPositions` (array with id/buddyOwnerId), `bombPosSet` (Set for O(1) bomb-at checks), `alivePlayerPosSet` (Set for O(1) player-at checks in line bomb)
- `hasBombAt()` / `hasAlivePlayerAt()` eliminated — replaced by Set lookups in `processPlayerInput()`. bombPosSet updated inline when new bombs are placed
- Chain reaction bomb lookup uses `Set<string>` of explosion cells — O(1) `has()` instead of O(cells) `Array.some()`
- KOTH hill controlling player cached during scoring step, reused in `toState()`
- Conditional tile snapshot: `map.tiles` deep-copy only when other bombs exist beyond those detonating (chain reactions possible)

## Serialization

- `Explosion.toState()` returns `this.cells` by reference — cells are deep-copied once in the constructor and immutable thereafter, eliminating ~150 object spreads/tick
- `mapEvents` serialization cached with dirty flag (`_mapEventsCache` / `_mapEventsDirty`) — events change ~1-2 times/min, but `toTickState()` is called every tick. Both `toState()` and `toTickState()` share the cache via `getSerializedMapEvents()`
- `mapToArray()` helper replaces `Array.from(map.values()).map(fn)` chains in `toState()` — single-pass iteration, halves intermediate allocations
- `DIR_DELTA_ARRAY` module-level constant in BotAI replaces 12 `Object.values(DIR_DELTA)` calls per bot per tick
- BotAI `aliveEnemies` computed once in `generateInput()` and reused for stalemate detection

## Frontend Rendering

- BombSprite and PowerUpSprite reuse class-level `_activeIds` Set — `clear()` + `add()` instead of `new Set(items.map(...))` per frame (~240 allocations/sec eliminated)
- GameScene emote positions use class-level `_emotePositions` Map — `clear()` + `set()` instead of `new Map()` per frame (~60 Map + ~480 object allocations/sec eliminated)
- HUD stats bar uses persistent element refs — creates DOM once, updates `textContent`/`opacity` only when values change (no innerHTML rebuild per tick)
- Kill feed tracks individual DOM elements — appends new entries, removes expired ones directly
- Team indicator drawn at Graphics origin, positioned via `setPosition()` — eliminates `clear()` + `fillRoundedRect()` every frame
- Shield graphic drawn at origin with `setPosition()` for positioning
- Dust particle emitter pooled per player — one persistent emitter repositioned and reused
- ReplayLogPanel uses `DocumentFragment` for batch DOM insertion

## Database & Backend

- Admin dashboard stats consolidated into single SQL query with subselects (3 queries -> 1)
- Match history uses pre-aggregated JOIN for player count instead of correlated subquery per row
- `friendships(user_id, status)` composite index (migration 022) — covers all friend list, count, and status queries
- Connection pool `queueLimit: 100` prevents unbounded memory growth under sustained DB pressure
- `ReplayRecorder.recordTick()` takes tile diffs from the tick state (full-grid rescan only for callers without diffs); countdown ticks are not recorded
- `listReplays()` uses async `fs.promises.readdir()` + `Promise.all(stat())` — unblocks event loop for servers with many replays
- Presence updates batched via `setPresenceBatch()` Redis pipeline — 1 round-trip instead of N on game/campaign start
- Socket room handlers (leave, ready, start, restart, setTeam, setBotTeam, rematch:vote, disconnect) use `socket.data.activeRoomCode` instead of `getPlayerRoom()` Redis lookup

## Game Logging

- JSONL game logs written to `./data/gamelogs/` (bind-mounted from container)
- Logs every bot decision, kill, bomb placement/detonation, and tick snapshots
- Filename format: `{ISO-timestamp}_{roomCode}_{gameMode}_{playerCount}p.jsonl`
- `GameLogger` supports 3 verbosity levels: normal (tick every 5), detailed (tick every 2 + movements/pickups), full (every tick + explosion detail + bot pathfinding)
- `GameLogger` enhanced with `shouldLogTick()`, `logMovement()`, `logPowerupPickup()`, `logExplosionDetail()`, `logBotPathfinding()` — all backward-compatible
- Simulation logs written to `./data/simulations/{gameMode}/batch_*/` with separate directory per game mode
